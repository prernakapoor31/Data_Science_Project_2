Problem: 
What predicts the Airbnb price? What directs the Airbnb rental price? Number of beds? Number of guest allowed? Review score? Location? Neighbourhood? Type of property? Type of room?

Insights from these questions provide interesting benefits to the host looking to maximize their profit and for anyone who wants to start airbnb business in Los Angeles.

Approach/Models: 
The question falls into the category of regression and prediction, so linear regression models are used. To compare the model, Decision Tree regressor and Random forest regressor are used.
